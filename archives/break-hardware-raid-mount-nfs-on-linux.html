	<h2 class="title"> Centos Install failure on a media that was RAID configured, mounting NTFS partition </h2>

<p> 
If you ever run into a situation where CentOS 7.x installation fails on a media which was used initially to 
configure hardware RAID - please read on to my situation and hopefully that will help you to resolve or 
at the minimum lead to some pointers.

</p> 

<p> 
I had two Hardware RAID's configured - 2 SSD's (OCZRAID0) and 4 Spinning Disks (HITACHI0). I had the OCZRAID0
where the Window 7.x was installed and HITACHIRAID0 used for storing data. 

I had to move out of state and hence unplugged all the drives and re-plug them during assembling my CPU back.


	
</p> 
<p> 
Unfortunately the system didn't boot and after I plugged the drives back in even though it was in exact sequence. Issue
was RAID failure. I later realized that the HITACHIRAID0 was marked as bootable vs. OCZRAID!

</p> 
<p> 
<p> 
I don't know the root cause for it, but for what it's worth that gave me a good excuse to install CentOS 7.x.
</p> 

<p> 
Here are few things that I ran into as issues when I tried installation on that CentOS 7.x after breaking the Hardware RAID - OCZRAID0
</p> 

<p> 
 
</p>
 

<p> 
So on the BIOS I deleted the OCZRAID, so my two SSD's are now individual drives and Windows! gone for ever.
The installation of CentOS7.x failed. The intial attempt was done by GUI and so on the screen where you select teh language
it got stuck!

<p/>

<p> 
I then changed to text install mode, to do so. On the screen where you see "Install the media" , press "Esc" and type
"linux text" 
</p>


<p> 
The installation failed still where it tried to scan the drives (two SSD's which were used to intially create OCZRAID0) with an
error stating unable to find /dev/sda!!
</p>



<pre>

So clear the metadata of the RAID drives. With the installation media in text mode type ctrl + b which should 
drop you to a shell. The drives should all be visible if you were to fdisk -l

[root@panchajanya intercloudzone.com]# blockdev --getsz /dev/sda
117231408



Zero out first few blocks and also last few where the RAID metadata resides.


dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1024 count=1000

Seek (SKIP) the initial blocks for faster performance of the dd (instead of doing teh whole disk)

[root@panchajanya intercloudzone.com]# echo "117231408 - 1024 " | bc -l
117230384

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda seek=117230384 bs=1025 count=1000

</pre>


 
<pre> 

   41  mount -l
   45  mount /dev/md126p2 /tmp/nfs2
  112  mount /dev/md126 /tmp/nfs/
  116  mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/md126 /tmp/nfs/
  119  mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/md126p1 /tmp/nfs/
  263  cp block-nfs-hacking-using-ebtables.html break-hardware-raid-mount-nfs-on-linux.html
