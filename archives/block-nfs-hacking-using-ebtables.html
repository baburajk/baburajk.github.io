	<h2 class="title"> NFS Data Hacking using NAT/ARPSPOOF and preventing it using EBTABLES </h2>

<p> 
	This is a three phased approach: 
</p> 

<p> 
1. How can you protect data by establishing security on NFS mounts.	
</p> 
<p> 
2. How can you possibly work around in hacking that data still - a security breach so to speak.
</p> 
<p> 
<p> 
3. Knowing a security breach occured what methods can be employed to further tighten it.  
</p> 

<p> 
So on highlevel - 
</p> 

<p> 
	NFS shared mount access can be restricted to IP address's.
</p>

<p> 
	Using NMAP Scans - we can obtain information on the neighbouring hosts on the same subnets.
</p> 

<p> 
	By spinning up Virtual IP's and arpspoofs/arpings and also using NAT rules the server can still be accessed.
</p> 

<p> 
	The level of granularity in securing this attack can be blocked by controling/using MAC address association - this can be accomplished using EBTABLES. 
</p> 

<p> 
I have given a detailed picture of how NFS hacking can be done. i.e Step 1,2,3 described above already on my previous article -'NFS Hacking using NAT (Network-Address-Translation)'
I shall still capture the steps here, but focus or goal is to how to accomplish #3.

</p>

<p>	
So the basic setup remains same. 
RBNETOPS will the NFS Server which is used to spin up the shared mounts
RBNETAPP and RBNETLAB are two clients given access to mount their respective shares with access restricted by it's own IP Addressess.
RBNETLAB will then be considered as a malicious host - who attempts to do network scan to identify the hosts around - finds and attempts
to mount the directory owned by RBNETAPP and successfully mounts it.
 </p>

<p> 
System admins at RBNETOPS later realizes that there's a security breach and a gap that need to filled up.This is where EBTABLES will come into play.
</p>

<p> 
We need bridging because ultimately we need to setup ebtable rules which solely works on ETHERNET bridging.
Bridge as the name implies acts as a bridge between two ethernets for packet traversal. Usually bridging is done by physical devices but can also be setup within the Linux kernel using bridge modules. 
So to start with we need to install the bridge utils RPM. 
</p> 
	
<pre>
yum install bridge-utils
</pre>				 
				

<p> 
	By default bridges are not configured and ebtables can only work on ETHERNET bridges. So first - add the bridge. At this point a bridge is created by
	no interfaces/IP addresses are tied to it.
<p/>

<pre>

[root@rbnetops ~]# brctl addbr brnfs

[root@rbnetops ~]# brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
brnfs           8000.000000000000       no

</pre>

<p> 
Before proceeding with any further steps, here is a snapshot of network interfaces and IP address associated with each.
</p>


<pre>
[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# ifconfig
enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.56.151  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.56.255

        inet 192.168.2.151  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255
        inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fecb:b503  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:cb:b5:03  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 14904  bytes 1963214 (1.8 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1088  bytes 95241 (93.0 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
... 

output trimmed to omit loopback interface..
</pre>	
	
<p> 
Ideally bridging is done using two or more physical devices. In my case 192.168.56.151 is an interface defined as a 'Host-Only-Adapter' within VirtualBox
and 192.168.2.151 is a 'Bridged Adapter' - basically I bridged that to my physical interface. Since these aren't same type of NIC's I wanted to avoid mixing
up/using both NIC's to create the bridge. Hence going with only one enp0s8 here for the purpose of demo.

The IP address of the NIC has to be set to 0.0.0.0 
</p>
 
<pre>
[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# ifconfig enp0s8 0.0.0.0 down
</pre>	
	
<p> 
Attach the ethernet interface to the bridge.Once added you can see the bridge name and interfaces associated with it
All these setups are temporary. In order for a permanent configuration the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s8
file need to be edited to add the brdige details so the configuration stays.

</p>
 
<pre>
 
[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# brctl addif brnfs enp0s8

[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
brnfs           8000.080027cbb503       no              enp0s8

</pre>	
	
<p> 
 Bring up the interface, as you can see there is no IP address associated with enp0s8.
</p>

Bring the bridge interface up, you can see it's up and RUNNING although there isn't an IP address associated with it still.

brctl command has options which can be used to show what MAC addresses are being discovered by the bridge that it can communicate with.

Now attach an IP address to the bridge interface.

<p> 
Now move onto RBNETLAB and configure the VIP (Virutal IP ) - using the IP address of RBNETAPP's machine. If you have logged in using putty/ssh to RBNETAPP
using the ip address 192.168.2.152 you will potentially loose connectivity because of IP address conflicts now on the same subnet.

<p> 
Here are the steps to do NAT'ing otherwise we need to mangle the packets. 
</p>

<p>
There are two steps here. One is doing Source NAT and another is Destination NAT. Source NAT is done 
in POSTROUTING chain so that the packets right before packets were being sent out by kernel 
it's mangled to make sure the outgoing IP address is 192.168.2.152 ( Virutal IP).
</p>

<p>
Same is the case with the PREROUTING chain, any incoming packets received are intercepted
and mangled so that the local kernel processes once they receive them will see it as a packet
came from 192.168.2.152.
</p>

<p>
Starting with Redhat/CentOS 7.x - the legacy IPTABLES are being taken over by firewalld. Basically 
firewalld offers lot of efficiency and it's wrapped around the legacy iptables so still allows 
to use the iptable rules to be defined. That's done through 'passthrough' functionality.
</p>
 
<pre>

firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -I POST_trusted -s 192.168.2.153 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.152
firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -I PRE_trusted -s 192.168.2.152 -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.153


[root@rbnetlab ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -I POST_trusted -s 192.168.2.153 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.152
success
[root@rbnetlab ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -I PRE_trusted -s 192.168.2.152 -j DNAT --to 192.168.2.153
success

</pre>	
	
<p> 
I ran into some issues with  PUBLIC zone of firewalld, so switched to 'trusted' zone
temporarily. Yet to figure out the reason as to why it didn't work but for now going
with 'trusted' zone.
</p>
 
<pre>
 [root@rbnetlab ~]#  firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=enp0s8
success
[root@rbnetlab ~]#  firewall-cmd --get-zone-of-interface=enp0s8
trusted

[root@rbnetlab ~]# firewall-cmd --zone=trusted
success

[root@rbnetlab ~]# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

Configure ebtables. EBTABLES is similar to IPTABLES but working in the Data Link Layer.
Right now as you can see the rules are empty.
</p>
 
<pre>

[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# ebtables -L --Lc
Bridge table: filter

Bridge chain: INPUT, entries: 0, policy: ACCEPT

Bridge chain: FORWARD, entries: 0, policy: ACCEPT

Bridge chain: OUTPUT, entries: 0, policy: ACCEPT

[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# systemctl start ebtables

</pre>	
	
<p> 

May be there's a way to setup the EBTABLE rules without the passthrough option (yet to explore), but with quite a few hurdles/learning this is
the only way I know now!

The main thing to note here is IP/MAC association in the rule. So basically when a request is triggered with our NAT and arpspoofing from RBNETLAP while
it hits RBNETOPS the ebtable rules kicks in and rules checks this association and will take the action according to the last parameter ( -j ACCEPT or -j DROP).


</p>
 
<pre>
 
On RBNETOPS run the below..

firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough eb -A INPUT -p IPv4 -s 08:00:27:85:30:eb --ip-src 192.168.2.152 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough eb -A INPUT -p IPv4 -s 08:00:27:b3:8b:b2 --ip-src 192.168.2.153 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough eb -A INPUT -p IPv4 --limit 5/min --limit-burst 2 --log-level notice --log-prefix "EBTABLE RULE VIOLATION" --log-ip --log-arp -j DROP
firewall-cmd --direct --passthrough eb -A INPUT -p IPv4  -j DROP

</pre>	
	
<p> 
Here is a snap of the rules after it's being added.
</p>
 
<pre>
 

[root@rbnetops network-scripts]# ebtables -L --Lc
Bridge table: filter

Bridge chain: INPUT, entries: 4, policy: ACCEPT
-p IPv4 -s 8:0:27:85:30:eb --ip-src 192.168.2.152 -j ACCEPT , pcnt = 0 -- bcnt = 0
-p IPv4 -s 8:0:27:b3:8b:b2 --ip-src 192.168.2.153 -j ACCEPT , pcnt = 0 -- bcnt = 0
-p IPv4 --limit 5/min --limit-burst 2 --log-level notice --log-prefix "EBTABLE RULE VIOLATION" --log-ip --log-arp -j DROP , pcnt = 0 -- bcnt = 0
-p IPv4 -j DROP , pcnt = 0 -- bcnt = 0

Bridge chain: FORWARD, entries: 0, policy: ACCEPT

Bridge chain: OUTPUT, entries: 0, policy: ACCEPT
</pre>	
	
<p> 
Now that rules are in place, attempt a mount again. The mount get's hung / stuck at the prompt...

</p>
 
<pre>
 
[root@rbnetlab ~]# mount -t nfs -o addr=192.168.2.152 rbnetops:/u01/data/nfsshare_rbnetapp /u01/hackit/  -v
mount.nfs: timeout set for Wed May  6 14:57:49 2015
mount.nfs: trying text-based options 'vers=4,addr=192.168.2.151,clientaddr=192.168.2.153'

</pre>	
	
<p> 

Now to look at or to find why the mount isn't happening, log back into RBNETOPS and see what's happening. You can see the packets are dropped by ebtables and if 
you refer back to the rules there's a log prefix added " --log-prefix "EBTABLE RULE VIOLATION"  which is what you can see in the logs as comments for every packet being
dropped. The limit-burst and limits on the rules prevent to flood the logs with repeated lines.
